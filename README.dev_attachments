Plans for adding attachment support to couchdb_connector.

I am considering two options.  One of them is cleaner in concept and the 
other is easier in code.  Both suffer from |> syntax problems since 
we must pass both dbprops and a document_id for the attachment.

Method 1
--------------------
Integrate function calls into Reader and Writer modules.  Those modules are so
clean this is distasteful for me.  It is however simple to do with a minimum
of code.  Something like:

- establish typespecs
- Add URL code
- add function(s) Reader.add_attachment(dbprops, doc_id, att_file_name, ...)
- add function(s) Writer.add_attachment(dbprops, doc_id, att_file_name, ...)


Method 2
------------------------------------------------
- typespecs
- URL code
- AttachmentReader module
- AttachmeentWriter module

Not too dissimilar to Method 1.

Please suggest thoughts in issues.


I'll start work in a few days so speak up.
